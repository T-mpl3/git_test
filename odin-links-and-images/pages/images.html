        <h1> Images </h1>
        <!-- JPG -->
        <h4> JPG </h4>
        <p>No Transparency but good color/color options.</p>
        <img src="../images/mochi.jpg" alt="Jpg image of cartoon face">
        <!-- GIF -->
        <h4> GIF </h4>
        <p>Simple animations but limited in color.</p>
        <img src="../images/mochi.gif" alt="GIF image of cartoon face.">
        
        <h4> PNG</h4>
        <p> Larger than JPG, has transparency and no limits on color options.
            These are good for professional logos.</p>

        <h4> SVG </h4>
        <p>While the rest were pixel based, SVGs are vector based, meaning it is scalable to any size
            without loss of quality. Good for responsive design.
